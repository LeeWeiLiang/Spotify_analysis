- Spotify's ad-supported and premium revenue increased by 2.55 times and 1.8 times respectively from 2017 to 2022.
- Spotify's ad-supported and premium cost increased by 2.88 times and 1.56 times respectively from 2017 to 2022.
- Ad-supported revenue is very closely with the ad-supported cost as the gross profits from ad-supported users are low and sometimes even negative.

- Spotify's ARPU has been on the decline (downward trend). This could likely be attributed to the disounts and bundle pricings to attract new subcribers
